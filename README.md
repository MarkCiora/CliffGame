# Cliff Game

## Description
Eventually this will be a game about building things along a cliff face. This project is done entirely in C++ with the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2) library.

If you would like to run my code and test the game out, put an issue up and I can help you set up SDL if needed.

Right now, I am working on a physics system. You can see a visualization of my collision detection system. Soon I will put a video or gif here in its place!
